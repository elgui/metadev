## When Workspaces Need to Coordinate

### Changes That Affect Multiple Workspaces

**Frontend + Backend coordination needed when**:
- Adding new API endpoints
- Changing existing API response formats
- Adding real-time features (WebSockets)
- Authentication flow changes

**Admin + Backend coordination needed when**:
- Adding new admin features
- Changing data models that affect admin views
- Adding new reporting capabilities
- Bulk operations or data exports

**Frontend + Admin coordination needed when**:
- Sharing UI components
- Consistent styling or user experience
- Similar functionality in both interfaces

**To**: [Which workspace you need help from]  
**What you need**: [Specific request]
**Why**: [What you're trying to build/fix]
**Timeline**: [When you need this]
**Impact if delayed**: [What happens if this is delayed]

### Context
[Brief explanation of what you're working on]

### Specific Requirements
- [List specific requirements]
- [Include any constraints or limitations]

### Success Criteria
[How you'll know the request is complete]
```

## Project Health Check

### What's Working Well
- [List things that are currently stable and working]

### Current Pain Points

### Recent Wins
- [List recent improvements or successful features]

## Development Workflow

### For New Features
1. **Plan**: Decide which workspace(s) are involved
2. **Design**: Figure out the user experience and technical approach
3. **Coordinate**: If multiple workspaces, plan the integration
4. **Build**: Implement in the appropriate workspace(s)
5. **Test**: Verify everything works together
6. **Deploy**: Release to users

### For Bug Fixes
1. **Identify**: Which workspace owns the problematic code
2. **Investigate**: Use the workspace's tools and knowledge base
3. **Fix**: Implement solution in the appropriate workspace
4. **Validate**: Ensure fix works and doesn't break anything else
5. **Document**: Update the workspace's KNOWLEDGE.md

### For Performance Issues
1. **Measure**: Get concrete numbers about the slowness
2. **Locate**: Identify which workspace/layer is the bottleneck
3. **Optimize**: Apply performance improvements in that workspace
4. **Verify**: Confirm measurable improvement
5. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on performance going forward

## Quick Commands

### Start Development Environment
```bash
# Frontend
cd client-workspace && npm start

# Backend  
cd backend-workspace && python manage.py runserver  # or equivalent

# Admin (if separate)
cd admin-workspace && npm start  # or equivalent
```

### Check System Health
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/

# Check frontend builds
cd client-workspace && npm run build

# Run tests
cd backend-workspace && python manage.py test
```

## Getting Help

### When You Need Cross-Workspace Help
1. **Update this file** with your coordination request
2. **Be specific** about what you need and when
3. **Provide context** about what you're trying to accomplish
4. **Include success criteria** so the other workspace knows when they're done

### When Working Solo
- Use the individual workspace AI-README files to give AI assistants proper context
- Document discoveries in the workspace KNOWLEDGE.md files
- Update this file when you complete major work that affects multiple workspaces

### When Working with a Team
- Use this file to coordinate who's working on what
- Update workspace status when you start/finish major work
- Share patterns and solutions across workspaces
