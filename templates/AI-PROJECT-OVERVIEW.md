# AI Project Overview (ai-agents/)

**Purpose**: This file helps AI assistants understand how all parts of your project connect. Save this as `ai-agents/AI-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` in your project.

**Important**: This is for AI agent coordination only. Your actual code stays in its normal project structure. This exists solely to help AI assistants understand your overall project when working across multiple areas.

## When AI Context Areas Need to Coordinate

### Changes That Affect Multiple Areas

**Frontend + Backend coordination needed when**:
- Adding new API endpoints
- Changing existing API response formats
- Adding real-time features (WebSockets)
- Authentication flow changes

**Admin + Backend coordination needed when**:
- Adding new admin features
- Changing data models that affect admin views
- Adding new reporting capabilities
- Bulk operations or data exports

**Frontend + Admin coordination needed when**:
- Sharing UI components
- Consistent styling or user experience
- Similar functionality in both interfaces

### How to Request Help from Another AI Context Area

**From**: [Your AI context area]
**To**: [Which area you need help from]  
**What you need**: [Specific request]
**Why**: [What you're trying to build/fix]
**Timeline**: [When you need this]
**Impact if delayed**: [What happens if this is delayed]

### Context
[Brief explanation of what you're working on]

### Specific Requirements
- [List specific requirements]
- [Include any constraints or limitations]

### Success Criteria
[How you'll know the request is complete]
```

## Project Health Check

### What's Working Well
- [List things that are currently stable and working]

### Current Pain Points
- [List things that are causing problems or frustration]

### Recent Wins
- [List recent improvements or successful features]

## Development Workflow

### For New Features
1. **Plan**: Decide which AI context area(s) are involved
2. **Design**: Figure out the user experience and technical approach
3. **Coordinate**: If multiple areas, plan the integration
4. **Build**: Implement in the appropriate area(s)
5. **Test**: Verify everything works together
6. **Deploy**: Release to users

### For Bug Fixes
1. **Identify**: Which AI context area owns the problematic code
2. **Investigate**: Use the area's tools and knowledge base
3. **Fix**: Implement solution in the appropriate area
4. **Validate**: Ensure fix works and doesn't break anything else
5. **Document**: Update the area's KNOWLEDGE.md

### For Performance Issues
1. **Measure**: Get concrete numbers about the slowness
2. **Locate**: Identify which area/layer is the bottleneck
3. **Optimize**: Apply performance improvements in that area
4. **Verify**: Confirm measurable improvement
5. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on performance going forward

```bash
# Frontend
cd [your-project] && npm start

# Backend  
cd [your-project] && python manage.py runserver  # or equivalent

# Admin (if separate)
cd [your-project] && [admin start command]
```

## Getting Help

### When You Need Cross-Area Help
1. **Update this file** with your coordination request
2. **Be specific** about what you need and when
3. **Provide context** about what you're trying to accomplish
4. **Include success criteria** so the other area knows when they're done

### When Working Solo
- Use the individual AI context files to give AI assistants proper context
- Document discoveries in the area KNOWLEDGE.md files
- Update this file when you complete major work that affects multiple areas

### When Working with a Team
- Use this file to coordinate who's working on what
- Update area status when you start/finish major work
- Share patterns and solutions across areas

## Important Reminders

### This is AI Coordination Only
- This file exists to help AI assistants understand your overall project
- Your actual code stays in its normal project structure
- The ai-agents/ folders are separate from your development work
- This is for AI context and coordination, not project management

### Focus on Real Information
- Include your actual project details, not template examples
- Update this file based on what actually helps with AI assistance
- Keep information current as your project evolves

### Keep It Simple
- Don't overcomplicate the coordination
- Focus on information that helps AI assistants work across areas
- Update when there are real changes that affect multiple areas
