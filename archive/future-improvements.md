### 5. Self-Healing Capabilities (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State**: Issue detection and reporting
**Future Vision**: Automated remediation
- Auto-fix for common issues
- Performance optimization automation
- Self-adjusting configurations
- Rollback mechanisms

**Safety Requirements**:
- Human approval workflows
- Change impact analysis
- Comprehensive testing
- Audit trails
