## 🎯 How Everything Fits Together

### For New Users

1. **Start with [README.md](README.md)** - Understand the core concept
2. **Follow [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Set up your first workspace
3. **Use [prompts/INDEX.md](prompts/INDEX.md)** - Find the right prompt template
4. **Reference [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - When things don't work

### For Implementation

1. **Copy workspace templates** from `templates/` directory
2. **Customize for your project** - Replace placeholders with your actual setup
3. **Add simple monitoring tools** from `templates/tools/` if helpful
4. **Use tested prompts** from `prompts/` directory for common tasks

### For Ongoing Use

1. **Update your workspace KNOWLEDGE.md** as you solve problems
2. **Share successes** using [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
3. **Improve templates** based on real usage patterns
4. **Help other developers** by documenting what works

## 🚀 Quick Start Paths

### Path 1: Frontend Developer with Performance Issues
1. Read `README.md` to understand the concept
2. Copy `templates/client-ai-readme.md` to your project
3. Customize it with your React/Vue/Angular setup
4. Use `prompts/debugging/performance-problems.md` template
5. Add `templates/tools/bundle-analyzer.js` for monitoring

### Path 2: Backend Developer with API Problems  
1. Read `README.md` for overview
2. Copy `templates/backend-ai-readme.md` to your project
3. Customize with your Django/FastAPI/Node.js setup
4. Use `prompts/debugging/simple-problem-solving.md` template
5. Add `templates/tools/api-health-checker.js` for monitoring

### Path 3: Full-Stack Team with Multiple Issues
1. Read `README.md` and `GETTING_STARTED.md`
2. Copy `templates/META-AI-README.md` for coordination
3. Set up workspace templates for each layer
4. Use `prompts/INDEX.md` to find relevant templates
5. Add monitoring tools as needed

### Path 4: Solo Developer Learning the Approach
1. Start with `GETTING_STARTED.md`
2. Pick one workspace (your biggest pain point)
3. Try one simple problem using the templates
4. Check `examples/todo-app-example.md` for inspiration
5. Reference `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` if stuck

## 🔧 Customization Guidance

### Workspace Templates
**Always customize these sections**:
- Project setup (your actual tech stack)
- Common problems (your real issues)
- Performance targets (your actual goals)
- Success criteria (your specific metrics)

**Keep these sections**:
- File structure explanations
- Integration guidance
- Emergency protocols
- Knowledge documentation patterns

### Prompt Templates
**Customize for your context**:
- Replace example technologies with yours
- Adjust complexity for your skill level
- Include your specific constraints
- Add your domain-specific terminology

**Keep the structure**:
- Clear problem description format
- Step-by-step approach requests
- Validation and testing requirements
- Documentation updates

### Monitoring Tools
**Adapt for your needs**:
- Change file paths and directories
- Adjust performance thresholds
- Modify endpoints and URLs
- Add project-specific metrics

**Maintain the principles**:
- Simple, understandable code
- Clear logging and output
- Command-line interface
- Easy to modify and extend
